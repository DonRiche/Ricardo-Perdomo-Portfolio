      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="assets/images/bioPic.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Ricardo Perdomo">

      <p>I was born and raised in Tegucigalpa, Honduras and now reside in Overland Park, Kansas. When I was not glued
        to a computer screen, I spent time drawing/ illustrating and chasing after my two young daughters Audrey 8 and
        Grey 3. I also have a 21 year old daughter, Valerie and a loving wife Nicole. My passion for creating also led
        to
        small t-shirt business
        called Audrilla Studios.</p>

      <p>I currently work at GOT systems ( a grocery inventory software company), gaining experience on the client
        management end, while I completes my certification as a web developer through The University of Kansas.</p>

      <p>While working for the company Sulavisi√≥n, a cable channel in my native Honduras and MOB Productions ( a small
        Private Production company); I gained experience as a graphic animator/editor and realized that I have a passion
        for the technical and design areas.</p>
